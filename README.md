Skroller
========

Skroller.js is a jQuery plugin that transforms elements such as div's into scrollable areas with customizable scrollbars that are consistent across different browsers

How it works
============

Simple, just call `skroller()` method on the jQuery selector and you are pretty much done... Relatively straightforward right?

A little visual example...

```

<div id="myDiv">
  Div content in here...
</div>

<script>
  $('#myDiv').skroller();
</script>

```

Easy enough, right?
